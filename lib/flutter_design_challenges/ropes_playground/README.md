## **Hanging Rope implementation in Flutter using Caternary algorithm**

An example of simulating a simple rope. For, the construction of rope, [catenary algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary) is used.<br>
The catenary is a curve that describes the shape of a hanging chain or cable, or the curve described by a freely hanging chain or cable.
The implementation of catenary algorithm is based on the following [js implementation](https://github.com/dulnan/catenary-curve/blob/9cb7e53e2db4bd5c499f5051abde8bfd853d946a/src/main.ts#L254).

Catenary dart algorithm [gist](https://gist.github.com/rutvik110/56f4626c95b92b8cf2c95283d4682331). The dart port isn't perfect yet and has some bugs but for majority of the part it works fine and is usable.
